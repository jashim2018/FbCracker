hi guys, I am 17 years old and i hope you support me . 

This is an application that performs a brute force attack against a
facebook user.

??? how does it work ???

well unlike other brute force attackers this app allows you to 
perform dual type if brute force attack
	1. the first one is the common app that we all know.
	2. and the second is the on that created it recently.

ofcourse you might ask why we need to have 2 types if brute force attacker
well this app allows you to attack against multiple accounts with only 
one password.
